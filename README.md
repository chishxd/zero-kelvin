> Reject Warmth. Embrace the Freeze

Project Zero Kelvin is a satirical Terminal-based survival game built in **Go** using the **Bubble Tea** Framework.

You play as an Aspiring Alpha Male attempting the legendary **Winter Arc**. Your goal is to survive for 30 days without freezing to death or succumbing to comfort.

**Intense PHONK playing**

Arrrgggghhh, are you THAT sigma gigachad around here hittin that 6-7 pose?
Well, you are the guy of prophecy. You shall take up the challenge of WINTER ARC. Conquer it to be hailed as the greatest Skibidi Alpha Male!

## The mechanics

The game is just balancing 3 stats

- **TEMPERATURE**
    - If it hits **< 30 C** you freeze to death
    - If it hits **> 60 c** you get "too cozy" and succumb to failure
    - Your body will naturally get warm over time
- **WILL**
    - Required to perform some tasks(like Gym)
    - Can be regained by reading
- **AURA**
    - The Ultimate goal to be reached. Obtained by suffering and detoxing

## Controls
- **[ c ] Cold Plunge:** Reduces temp. Can cause Hypothermia
- **[ g ] Gym:** You gain aura, but costs willpower and raise in body temp
- **[r] Read:** Restores Willpower. Time passes without much score gained

> You may get some random events during the game which will affect your stats... Think strategically
